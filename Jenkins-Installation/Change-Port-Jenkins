FOR UBUNTU 22.04
----------------
By default, Jenkins listens at Port 8080

To change this, so that Jenkins work on other user defined por, follow the steps.

For Example, If you want to use Port 3000 for the operation:

STEP 1: vi /etc/default/jenkins

# port for HTTP connector (default 8080; disable with -1)

HTTP_PORT=3000

STEP 2: vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service

Environment="JENKINS_PORT=3000"

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl restart jenkins

Check: VM-IP:3000 for jenkins
